Step Three: Test your own code

Get a feel for testing your own code

First we will build out functionality for removing a server from the server table

Review the functionality of appendTd(tr, value)

Create a appendDeleteBtn(tr), it will be similar to append(tr, value). This function will create a ‘td’ with the value ‘X’, when clicked it will delete the table row it belongs to

Write the functionality for appending a ‘td’ to a ‘tr’ with the value ‘X’

Set an click event listener on the ‘td’ that will remove the parent ‘tr’ from the dom. You will have to find a way to access the parent row of the ‘td’ from the click event

Write tests for appendDeleteBtn(tr)

You may notice the difficulty of simulating a click with vanilla javascript so do not spend too much time on testing the html after the DOM is updated (later we will study approaches for this with other libraries).

Repeat the process for removing a payment from the payment table
