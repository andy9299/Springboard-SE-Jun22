Part One: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms, define the following terms:

What is HTTP?
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It's the way data is arranged when sent between systems.

What is a URL?
Uniform Resource Locator. It's the address for where stuff is on the internet.

What is DNS?
Domain Name System. It's the system that takes URLs and turns them into IP addresses for the computer.

What is a query string?
For URLs, it allows key-value pairs to be passed in the URL.

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET - retrieve data
POST -  send data

What is an HTTP request?
It's a request from the client to the server using the HTTP protocol.

What is an HTTP response?
It's the response from the server to the client using the HTTP protocol.

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Headers are a way to put more information in the request or response.
request: Host, Accept, Cookie
Response: Content-Type, Last-Modified

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
1) The browser converts the URL into an IP address following DNS.
2) The browser makes a request to the IP address.
3) The server sends a response.
4) The browser makes a DOM based on the HTML.
5) The browser finds what else it needs (stuff like css/js files, images, other links etc).
6) The browser makes additional needed requests.
