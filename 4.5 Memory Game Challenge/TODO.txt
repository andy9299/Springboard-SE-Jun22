# Further Study:

- Add a button that when clicked will start the game
- Add a button that when clicked will restart the game once it has ended
- For every guess made, increment a score variable and display the score while the game is played
- Store the lowest-scoring game in local storage, so that players can see a record of the best game played.
- Allow for any number of cards to appear
- Instead of hard-coding colors, try something different like random colors or even images!
