# Further Study
There are a lot of other things you could do here:

Write tests for your functions. Practice writing software tests in a great way to get better at this critical developer skill!

Add other information/features from TVMaze. There are other things you can get from TV Maze—you could list the actors in a show, or the genres of a show, or other things.

Make the episodes into a Bootstrap modal. If you want to learn more about the components of Bootstrap, you could change you code so that it shows the list of episodes in a pop-up modal, rather than a list at the bottom of the page.

If you wrote the functions in part 3 well, you should be able to this only by having to change the populateEpisodes function, but not other parts of your JavaScript — a nice reward for breaking your code thoughtfully into good functions!
